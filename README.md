YouTube video downloader
More than a billion people watch YouTube every month. Sometimes there are videos we like to download permanently. YouTube doesn't give you that option, but I created an app with a simple Ul and the ability to download YouTube videos in different formats and video quality. Hope you enjoy it.

1. Download the .py file and open it in your python idle or VS which ever sofware you have instaled in your computer.
2. Run the file
3. Enter the URl of the video to be downloaded
4. Enter the quality of the video you want to download (eg: 1080p)
5. Tell/choose where the downloaded video should get saved using the browse button.
6. Click download!

Now, check the desired location and enjoy your favorite video! :)
